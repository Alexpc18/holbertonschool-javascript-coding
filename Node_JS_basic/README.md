Node.js is a runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting. It enables developers to create scalable and efficient network applications using event-driven, non-blocking I/O models. Node.js is known for its vast ecosystem of libraries (npm) and supports modern JavaScript (ES6+) features, making it popular for building APIs, real-time applications, and microservices.
